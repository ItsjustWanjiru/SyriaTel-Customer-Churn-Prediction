## Dataset

The project relies on a telecommunications dataset that contains various customer-related features, including customer service calls, charges, and international plan status. This dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis, predictive modeling, and strategy development.

## Project Parts

This project comprises several crucial components:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to clean and transform the data, making it suitable for analysis and modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This phase involves extensive exploration and visualization of the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.

3. **Model Development:** Various machine learning models are trained to predict customer churn, with a focus on Decision Trees and Random Forests.

4. **Dealing with Class Imbalance:** The challenge of imbalanced classes is addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance model performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search and cross-validation are conducted to optimize model hyperparameters for predictive accuracy.

6. **Feature Selection:** Feature importances are calculated to select the most influential attributes for predictive modeling.

7. **Random Forest Model:** The Random Forest model is fine-tuned and evaluated, demonstrating superior performance among models.

8. **Threshold Optimization:** The class prediction threshold is adjusted to achieve a balance between precision and recall, aligning the model with business goals.

9. **Model Deployment:** The final Random Forest model is saved for future churn predictions and business use.

10. **Conclusion:** A summary of the project findings and results, highlighting the model's predictive accuracy and the most influential factors in predicting churn.

11. **Recommendations:** Actionable strategies and insights for reducing customer churn and enhancing customer satisfaction.
